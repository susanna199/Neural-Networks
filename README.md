# Neural-Networks

Overview

This simulation explores the behavior of three foundational neural network architectures:

1. Perceptron
2. ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron)
3. MADALINE (Multiple Adaptive Linear Neurons)

Users can select these models, choose activation functions, configure learning parameters, and train them on the breast cancer dataset to observe their accuracy and behavior.

Project Objectives

- Implement classic neural networks from scratch using NumPy.
- Visualize training metrics (e.g., MSE or classification error).
- Compare model behaviors based on activation functions.
- Build interactive interfaces (Tkinter + Streamlit) to experiment with settings.

Observations:
Adaline

- It fails when the learning rate is too high.

Perceptron
